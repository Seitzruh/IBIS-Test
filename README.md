# IBIS-Test
an Android APP to send IBIS codes (VDV300) via USB to the IBIS bus with the LYNX Adapter from Julian Metzler. See https://xatlabs.com/de/produkte/lynx/
This Andoid APP uses the USB to Serial lib from Mike Wakerly see https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android
If the USB-Connection does not work, check the cables or the adapters. Not each OTG-Adapter will work proper. 

To use the APP just run it on your android device, than choose the right USB-Adpter (Vendor 0403 Product 60001) 
Than you can send IBIS-commands by tying in the commands or chose one by clicking on the I-button.
As you can not type in each command, there are a few buttons, to send special commands like DS21 etc.
These buttons uses the fields above, but may send additional records.
